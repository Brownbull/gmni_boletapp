Load the workflow definition from `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/atlas-e2e/workflow.yaml` and execute the instructions from `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/atlas-e2e/instructions.xml`.

This is an Atlas-enhanced E2E test workflow that includes:
- Persona analysis using Section 3 personas
- Workflow chain testing for complete user flows
- Acceptance criteria to test case mapping
- Behavioral testing patterns
- Memory feeding for new test patterns

Execute the workflow steps in order, consulting Atlas memory where indicated.
