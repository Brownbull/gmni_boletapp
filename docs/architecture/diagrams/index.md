## Quick Navigation

| Diagram | Description | Complexity |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| [Scan State Machine](./scan-state-machine.md) | Receipt scanning workflows (single, batch, statement) | High |
| [Transaction Lifecycle](./transaction-lifecycle.md) | How transactions are created and persisted | Medium |
| [Analytics Workflow](./analytics-workflow.md) | Drill-down navigation and data visualization | High |
| [Filtering System](./filtering-system.md) | Transaction filtering (temporal, category, location, groups) | High |
| [Data Caching](./data-caching.md) | React Query + Firestore real-time integration | High |
| [Tech Stack Overview](./tech-stack.md) | Technology layers and integrations | Medium |
| [Shared Groups Flow](./shared-groups-flow.md) | Cross-user transaction access with Cloud Function security | High |

## When to Use These Diagrams

### For New Team Members
Start with:
1. **Tech Stack Overview** - Understand the technology landscape
2. **Transaction Lifecycle** - Core data flow
3. **Scan State Machine** - Main feature workflow

### For Feature Development
Reference:
- **Scan State Machine** - When modifying receipt scanning
- **Analytics Workflow** - When adding visualization features
- **Filtering System** - When adding filter capabilities
- **Data Caching** - When optimizing performance

### For Code Reviews
Check:
- State machine transitions match diagram
- Caching patterns follow established conventions
- Filter composition follows AND logic

## Diagram Conventions

### Mermaid Syntax
All diagrams use [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) syntax, rendered natively in GitHub and VS Code.

### Color Coding
```
🟢 Green  - Success states, completed flows
🔵 Blue   - Normal/active states
🟡 Yellow - Warning/intermediate states
🔴 Red    - Error states
⚪ Gray   - Idle/initial states
```

### Arrow Notation
```
--> Solid arrow     - Primary flow / action
--> Dashed arrow    - Secondary flow / fallback
==> Double arrow    - Critical path / main workflow
```
