## Story

As a **developer**,
I want **npm audit vulnerabilities tracked and remediated**,
So that **known security vulnerabilities in dependencies are addressed**.

## Problem Statement

`npm audit` reports vulnerabilities that need to be tracked, triaged, and remediated on a regular basis. Currently there is no systematic process for this.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Run `npm audit` and document current state
- [ ] Remediate or document acceptable risk for each finding
- [ ] Add `npm audit` to CI pipeline (warn, not block)
- [ ] Document remediation process
