# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic exists in epic file but not contexted
#   - contexted: Next epic tech context created by *epic-tech-context (required)
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - drafted: Story file created in stories folder by *create-story
#   - ready-for-dev: Draft approved and story context created by *story-ready
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation by *dev-story
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review by *code-review

# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============

# - SM typically drafts next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', dev reviews, then Dev moves to 'done'

  # ============================================================================
  # STATUS: REVERTED to commit 68686f3 - Retrospective complete
  # OUTCOME: Epic failed due to architectural gaps in real-time sync
  # ROOT CAUSES: (1) Delta sync can't detect deletions, (2) State staleness after first op,
  #              (3) Cost explosion from full refetch fallback
  # DECISION: Reset epic, create 14c-refactor first, then retry as 14d

  #
  # KEY OBJECTIVES:
  # 1. Remove broken shared groups sync implementation (preserve UI shells)

  # 5. Audit and optimize Firebase infrastructure
  #
  # PRIOR ART: Epic 14d-old (Scan Architecture Refactor) already completed:
  # - ScanContext, useScanStateMachine, batch processing state
  # - Stories 14c.9-14c.11 PRESERVE this work and only extract non-scan contexts
