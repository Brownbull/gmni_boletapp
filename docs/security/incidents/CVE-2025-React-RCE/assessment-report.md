## Executive Summary

Following notification of critical RCE vulnerabilities CVE-2025-55182 and CVE-2025-66478 affecting React Server Components in React 19.x and Next.js 14.3+/15.x/16.x, an assessment was performed on the boletapp project. **The project is not affected** as it uses React 18.3.1 with Vite (no Next.js) and deploys as a static SPA to Firebase Hosting.

## Project Analysis

### Dependencies Assessed

| Package | Project Version | Vulnerable Range | Status |
|---------|----------------|------------------|--------|
| react | ^18.3.1 | 19.0 - 19.2.0 | ✅ Safe |
| react-dom | ^18.3.1 | 19.0 - 19.2.0 | ✅ Safe |
| next | Not installed | 14.3.0-canary.77+, 15.x, 16.x | ✅ N/A |

### Architecture Assessment

| Factor | This Project | Risk Level |
|--------|--------------|------------|
| Framework | Vite + React SPA | None |
| React Server Components | Not used | None |
| Server-Side Rendering | None (static build) | None |
| Hosting | Firebase Hosting (static files) | None |
| Runtime Environment | Client-side only | None |

### Key Findings

1. **React Version Safe:** Project uses React 18.3.1, which predates the vulnerable React 19.x line entirely.

2. **No Next.js:** Project uses Vite as build tool, not Next.js. The vulnerable React Server Components feature is a Next.js/React 19 specific technology.

3. **Static Deployment:** The application builds to static assets (`vite build`) and deploys to Firebase Hosting. No server-side code execution surface exists.

4. **No Attack Vector:** The RCE vulnerabilities require server-side React component rendering. This project has no server-side rendering capabilities.

---

## Conclusion

**No remediation required.**

The boletapp project is architecturally immune to CVE-2025-55182 and CVE-2025-66478 due to:
- Using React 18.x (not 19.x)
- Not using Next.js
- Not using React Server Components
- Deploying as static SPA with no server runtime

---

## Recommendations

While not currently affected, consider the following for future security posture:

1. **Monitor React 19 Migration:** If/when upgrading to React 19.x, ensure version 19.2.1+ is used.

2. **Avoid Next.js Canary:** If Next.js is ever adopted, avoid canary releases in production.

3. **Maintain Dependency Audits:** Continue running `npm audit` and security checks as part of CI/CD.
