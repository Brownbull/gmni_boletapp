I analyzed 50 SaaS onboarding flows 🪼 here’s what separates the best from the rest
Been obsessed with onboarding lately.

I've shipped a few products over the years and the pattern was always the same: people sign up, poke around, leave, never come back.

So I spent the last couple weeks going through 50 different SaaS onboarding flows and taking notes.

Signed up for everything from Notion to random indie tools on Product Hunt.

Here's what I found.

The 5 most common mistakes:

1. Asking for too much upfront The worst offenders asked for 6+ fields before I could even see the product. Name, email, company, role, team size, use case…

I bounced from at least 8 products before finishing signup.

The best ones? Calendly just asks for an email. You're in.

2. Empty dashboard with no direction This one's brutal. You sign up, you're excited, and then… a blank screen.

Maybe a sidebar with 15 options. No idea where to start.

Notion handles this well with starter templates. Linear drops you into a sample project.

The key is giving people something to interact with immediately.

3. The 15-step product tour "Click here. Now click here. This is your settings page. This is where you invite teammates. This is…"

Nobody retains this. I found myself clicking "Next" just to make it stop.

The best apps don't explain, they just get you doing things.

4. No progress indicators Humans want to complete things. "Step 2 of 4" is weirdly motivating.

A never-ending list of tasks with no end in sight? I'm out.

5. Skip = gone forever Letting users skip onboarding is fine.

But most apps have no way back. You skip, and now you're on your own.

The better approach: a persistent checklist in the corner, or a "Getting Started" section you can return to.

What the best onboarding flows do:

1. Time to value under 60 seconds This was the clearest pattern.

The best apps get you doing the core action almost immediately.

Loom: recording a video in ~30 seconds

Canva: editing a design in under a minute

Superhuman: reading an email immediately

No lengthy explanations. Just doing.

2. One CTA per screen Every screen has one obvious thing to do. No competing buttons. No choices. Just: do this thing.

Figma's onboarding is basically: create a file → draw something → invite someone.

That's it.

3. Checklists over tours Interactive checklists outperformed product tours every time.

Tours are passive - you just click through.

Checklists make you take action, which builds investment.

Plus there's something satisfying about checking boxes😉.

4. Celebrating wins Sounds cheesy, but it works.

Notion's confetti when you complete setup. Duolingo's little animations.

These micro-celebrations keep you going.

5. Smart defaults and pre-filled examples The best apps don't make you create from scratch.

They give you templates, examples, placeholder text that shows you what to do.

The goal is making it nearly impossible to get stuck.

6. Progressive disclosure Don't show everything on day one.

The best apps feel simple early on and reveal complexity as you grow.

Airtable does this well - it looks like a spreadsheet until you need it to be more.

7. Personalization that actually changes the experience Not "Hi [First Name]" - actual personalization.

Ask what they'll use the product for, then show relevant templates/features.

Skip the stuff they don't need.

Tools worth checking out:

If you dont want to build everything from scratch, here's what I've been looking at:

Jelliflow - record your app and it generates the whole flow automatically. Tooltips, modals, checklists, all of it.

Appcues - solid for larger teams, lots of features but takes time to set up

Userpilot - good analytics, bit of a learning curve

Userflow - clean UI, decent for mid-size products

Chameleon - been around a while, good if you need deep customization

No perfect answer here, depends on your budget and how much time you wanna spend configuring stuff.

Takeaway:

The pattern is pretty clear: get users to value fast, don't overwhelm them, and make it feel like progress.
