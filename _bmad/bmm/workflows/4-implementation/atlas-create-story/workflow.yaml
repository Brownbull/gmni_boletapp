# What Atlas adds to create-story:
# 1. Analyzes story requirements against existing workflow chains
# 2. Provides PUSH ALERTS if story affects existing workflows
# 3. Suggests additional acceptance criteria based on workflow impact
# 4. Feeds story intent to Atlas memory after creation
# 5. ANALYZES STORY SIZE to prevent context window overflow
#    - Step 5b: PRE-GENERATION estimate based on epic descriptions (early warning)
#    - Step 6: POST-GENERATION validation of ACTUAL task/subtask counts (CRITICAL!)
#    - Bug fix 2026-01-24: Step 5b alone didn't catch story 14e-6 (47 subtasks)
#      because the story hadn't been generated yet when it ran
#    - Prevents post-hoc splits that waste development cycles (lesson: 14c-refactor.22a)
# 6. DUAL-MODE: Can analyze existing stories for sizing issues
#    - Batch analysis from sprint-status
#    - Interactive split recommendations
#    - Consolidates atlas-story-sizing functionality

# Bug Fix History:
# - 2026-01-24: Added POST-GENERATION sizing check in Step 6
#   Story 14e-6 was created with 47 subtasks (3.1x limit) because Step 5b
#   ran BEFORE the story was generated. Now Step 6 validates ACTUAL content.
